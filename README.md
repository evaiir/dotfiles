# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

One day, this repo shall be the glorious home of my dotfiles.  
  
As for now, it will only serve to copy my neovim and kitty configs to my uni setup,  
and everything else will live in shame, hiding deep in the caves of .gitignore,  
waiting forever, dreaming of being organized and worth of being in display.
